# Project II using React
## Requirements and Guidelines  #

### Introduction

The time is here to kickoff project for Unit 2, taking everything we have learned into one web application. Set up the front end (Client side). You can pick the theme you will be working on and the time frame will be 3 days. Let's see what we can do!

This project will showcase the React with state management in between components using Redux which has been learned in this part of the course. 

### High Level Goals
The goal of this project is to practice individually on creating a dynamic website using what you have learned in Unit 2.

## Project Requirements

The following minimum requirement should be  met in the project:

* Your time should be focused on creating something you are pasionate about. Something that might help you or others.
* You should implement DRY principles for the rest of your life :smile:
* As a user you have to be able to navigate some information and display it.
* Plan ahead of coding by having some wireframing.
* Prepare slides for the project presentation.
* There needs to be a plan before hand that needs to be aproved by your instructor.
* You have to use ReactJS, Express, Node, Axios, Class based components (with states and life cycle methods) or Function based components with hooks useState, useEffect, useParams, useNavigate.
* Your application should be responsive starting with MOBILE FIRST, needs to have a tablet version and a desktop version.
* CRUD operations are mandatory.
* Create the Github repository for your project, and push the code frequently to the repository, **at least twice** every day.
* Project should also have a readme file describing the project
* Get the repos documented to your instructors to see before you start coding.
* Project must be ready before the deadline.
  
  

## Project Ideas
The project ideas will be given to you and are added as well. The implementation of the idea should meet the minimum project requirements.
- The idea should be big enough to work on it for the whole project duration, and still have extra features to work on in the future.
- Don't be afraid to have creative thoughts and features that you may add them in the projects. if you are not sure how it could be implemented we will help you out.
- Get your project approved by the teaching staff. 
- Following is the list of projects for inspiration:
  - Clone for [Absher](https://www.absher.sa/portal/landing.html) (Individuals) Dashboard
  - Clone for [Tawakkalna](https://ta.sdaia.gov.sa/en/index) Dashboard

## Project Stretch Goals

- Properly placed files for the User Interface Design based on React Library for the client side.
- Similarly, server side of the application should also have proper structure. 
- The website must be dynamic.
- Must have multiple components, and information flow between these components.
- Make sure to write clean code with good style (use Prettier).
- The code should comply with coding standards, i.e. variables should have proper names, code should be readable etc.
- Use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to style your application properly.
-  Use[React Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) to take user input. Try using [Formik](https://formik.org) to design input forms.
- Fully responsive design for both mobile and desktop using CSS media queries.


## Bonus
- Will be added, so keep refreshing the page! ;)

# Testing in Javascript homework

- Create a Javascript file that has your name (ex: fawzi.js) and create the following functions: \
1- `biggestNumber` function that takes 3 numbers and returns the biggest number of the three.\
2- `squareAll` function that takes an array parameter and returns an array with the number each numbered multiplied by itself\
3- `removeLetterE` function that takes a string parameter and removes the letter (e) and then returns the string.
- Create a testing file for testing the functions created with the same naming as before (ex: fawzi.test.js), and write tests to check if the functions are working correctly\
**try to think of edge cases to test if your functions work correctly on them**

- inside a react app, create a test file that has the following tests, then create a react component that passes these tests.\
1- test if the component contains the following text:"this component is for testing purposes".\
2- test if the component contains an `<h1>` html element

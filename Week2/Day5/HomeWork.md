### Home Work Week 02 Day 5 - SPA using React Routing


*Make single page application:*
Given a list of products (as an array of objects, as seen in data.js) [here](data.js). Using the same approach, we saw in the class today, get the details for product from the products.js (using an export function inside products.js) 
Render the product details in `<Product />` component (which you'll also need to create) for each product in the list.

Also add the images for each of the products using some url online!

Make sure to use the array's `.map()` method to create the links and show them inside Products component.

```js
import getProducts from "./data"

function Products() {
  return (
    <div>
        
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Bonus: Instead of displaying the names, display products by their image, and then by clicking on image, go to details component.

# Home Work:  React Components

Imagine that you are using React to create a front-end for a fictitious
(or real if you have a customer in mind) company of your choice:
- Create a header component that displays a logo (see here for help) and
company name. It should either welcome a user to the site or ask them to sign in.
- Create a landing page component that tells the user about the company.
- Create a product component that displays information about the products
that the company sells or services that the company offers.
- Also add the footer component showing some address of the company and back to top link.
- Edit your existing App.js file so that it displays the header component, the landing page component and the product components. 
  
:exclamation: Make sure that your application is attractively styled and stuffed with the content as well. Use any custom CSS and/or CSS libraries of your choice in this regard.

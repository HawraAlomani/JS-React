# React props

Props are the building block of react components. They define the properties (the data) a component has!
Consider the following code: 
```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <a>This is a link</a>
        <input />
        <img />
    </body>
</html>
```

The code above needs the attributes to work, other wise, it will make no difference / effect. As shown in the following
```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <a href="https://google.com">This is a link</a>
        <input placeholder="First Name" name="" type=""/>
        <img src="local path OR url"/>
    </body>
</html>
```

These attributes are formally known as the properties or props of the tags! If we can understand them, we can now understand the idea of props in react is easy to understand as we make our own components, so we can copy our own data to the components.

:star: The bottomline is that props help us to make **reuseable** components.

Let's go to the exercises to understand and use props.

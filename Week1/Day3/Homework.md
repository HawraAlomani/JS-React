# Week 1 Day 3 Home work

### Conditional Statements 

#### FizzBuzz

- Create a variable that accepts a number from prompt.

- If it is a multiple of 3, return “Fizz” instead of the number.

- If it is a multiple of 5, return “Buzz” instead of the number.

- If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, return “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

- Otherwise, return the number

As shown in the following example:

```js

// number: 3  => Output : Fizz
// number: 5  => Output : Buzz
// number: 15 => Output : FizzBuzz
// number: 7  => Output : 7
```


### Bootstrap

Follow these steps:
- Find a published webpage that you like (not something you’ve already made). It could be from Netflix, takealot, ucook, or any other website you like.
- Create an HTML file called copy-cat.html.
- Using HTML and CSS, try to recreate the webpage as best you can.
- Add the URL of the webpage you are recreating as a link at the bottom of
your webpage.
- You may want to do some research on more CSS elements for greater
functionality.


#### Bonus:
- Your choice is different from rest of your fellows.
- Responsive Design

#### Functions
Create a file with name Week1Day3FnHw.js. Inside this file:
* Create a function that will get the sum of the numbers between 1 and n and return the answer 
`summation(5)` // should return 15 because 1+2+3+4+5=15
* Create a function to get the sum of all the even numbers in a group 
`summationEven(5)` // should return 6 because 2+4=6

#### Rolling Dice

For this home work, you'll be creating a page that displays a random update of two dice every time the user hits the "Roll Dice" button. To get started, open the [app.js file](Homework/dice/js/app.js). Use the HTML and CSS code included in the Home work folder.

>Note: We haven't covered DOM Manipulation yet, but you will need some familiarity with [document.getElementById](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) to complete this exercise.
